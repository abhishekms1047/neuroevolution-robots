# Neuroevolution-Bots
Neuroevolution-Bots is a personal project that demonstrates [neuroevolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution) in a browser environment using [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) (for neural nets) and HTML5 Canvas (for graphics). I tried to create a scaled down 2D version of the popular [Gym's Humanoid-v2 environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Humanoid-v2/) using [Planck.js](http://piqnt.com/planck.js/), a JavaScript rewrite of Box2D.

## TRY THE DEMO: [here](https://github.com/mishig25/neuroevolution-robots)

*live training is happening in your browser. Try dragging one of the bots
